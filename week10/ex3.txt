To make equal permissions:
chmod u=a <filename>

We have 9 bits for Owner, Group and Others
Each 3 bits are assigned to a group (r,w,x). If we want to assign r&w to Owner, first number must be 110 in binary, which means 6 in decimal.

660: Owner-rw; Group-rw; Others-none
775: Owner-rwx; Group-rwx; Others-rx
777: rwx to Owner, Group and Others
